## Installation through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

There is an active [PR](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/2711) to get this into [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), once that is merged then you can install the **Evri** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

Until then you will have to add this repository manually:

Go to HACS -> 3 dot menu -> Custom Repositories:- 

Paste `https://github.com/jampez77/Evri` into Repository field and select `Integration`

Now you should be able to find it in HACS as normal.

You can install the **Evri** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

## Manual Installation
Use this route only if you do not want to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and love the pain of manually installing regular updates.
* Add the `evri` folder in your `custom_components` folder

## Data 
The integration will automatically create a `Tracked Parcels` sensor. This will show the total number of tracked parcels and the attrributes will list them by tracking number. Additionally it will also has an attribute list for parcel that are currently out for delivery.


Tracking parcels is done entirely via the `track_a_parcel` service call / action. An entity will be create for each parcel and it will automatically be deleted 24 hours after the registered delivery date. There is an optional `post code` paramameter for tracking a parcel, using the delivery post code will retreive more details.
